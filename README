Downloading & installing plugins is easy. Not all of them turn out to be 
of actual use and you forget about them. This plugins helps you identify 
plugins you have installed but do not actually use that often to justify 
cluttering your 'runtimepath' and thus slowing down startup time. Simply 
make sure this plugin is loaded on startup. After a few days, use the 
|:Pluginstats| command to check which script files were loaded how 
often.

Features:
    - The |:Pluginstats| command displays script use in CSV format.
    - If |g:pluginstats_autoexport| is greater than zero, the statistics 
      are exported automatically every N days.
